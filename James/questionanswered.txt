The question that I wanted answered from our analysis was if Amazon had garnered a lot of it's success due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, would there have been a marked difference
in their stock value change after the first Covid vaccination dosage was released on April 19, 2021. 

Prior to the vaccination release all throughout the pandemic beginning from January 2020, there was a sizable and consistent increase in closing stock value for Amazon
that nearly doubled it's worth over the course of the year. After the release of the vaccine, their stock appeared to flux rapidly for the first time in over a year, 
with it ending at nearly the same value at the end of the 2021st year as it was at the time of the vaccine release. 

This may be due to how people who were vaccinated no longer relied on deliveries, and were adamant about leaving quarantine. However, another contribution may have been 
indicisivness of individuals in getting vaccinated, and there may have been concerns regarding mutations that would come out. At this time, more information is needed,
but the release of the vaccine quite possibly contributed greatly to this fluxuation in stock value.
